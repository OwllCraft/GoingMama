**GoingMama**  is a flappy bird clone, long-runner, 2D, arcade mini-game, which is dedicated to my mom, as her birthday present. This is my first developed mini-game I've made using a graphics library, SFML.

##### ANY FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED!

#### HOW TO PLAY?

The game is very similar to flappy bird, simply tap or click the screen to fly and avoid the pillars which is standing in your way, and once you passed the pillars, you gain score points. The more score you've gain, the greater you are as a player. Ride your rocket, to aim to the highest!

**CONTROLS:**  

Left Mouse Button - Fly

I've presented the game to her birthday since August 6. and she really loves it so far. She really likes the colors of the sprites because it matches to her favorite color. She tried to play it and scored 10 as her highest score. She wanted me to publish it as a mobile game, but sadly I'm not at that level yet and I still need much to learn. So far, I'm glad she loves it!

#### Happy Birthday Mom!
